        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jake Sparrer. I'm currently a student at University of California Riverside. This is my third year in college and I am enjoying the majority of it. I grew up in San Jose, California, so being away from home was difficult at first. Luckily, I found my home with a group of caring people. I believe I have developed exponetially throughout my 2.25 years in riverside. I learned how to become independent and manage my time. I had to learn how to not depend on anyone but myself since I moved away from my parents. While I have developed many skills, I want to keep learning and put myself in new situations. Throughout college, I have gained many skills and learned from past experiences. In high school, I was varsity swim captain. This role played a big part in my strives for being a leader in my professional life. Throughout the second half of high school and college, I have gained experience in multiple professions.<br><br>

        During my junior year of high school, I worked at a law firm. During this job, I was a file clerk and receptionist. I would answer client's calls and order records. Throughout the day, I would file any papers for the office. These files were categorized by County or City, and withing each file cabinet, they were sorted by last name. This taught me how to be efficient since the task required a lot of time. I also gained communication skills by answering phones. I gained a proffessional voice, and charisma skills as well. My next job was a server at a country club. This job was one of my favorites out of the three. During my time as a server, I learned many different. skill. Starting off, I was a back-server. This job entail many tedious tasks. I developed multi-tasking skills and time management. Since I had to clear tables, clean dishes, and setup place settings, I was able to manage different tasks. After working as a back-server, I moved up to a server. This required me to memorize the menue, speak directly to customers, and micro-manage my orders.<br><br>

        After being a server for 2 years, I was offered a temporary job as a receptionist at a self-driving car company. This company had a very modern environment, and progressive work environment. During my time as a receptionist, I would ask clients to sign a nondisclosure agreement. For the actual workers, they would have to swipe their card. Being surrounded by intelligent minds and a modern environement, I hope to work in a similar job as this one. Being an economics administration major and a focus in management information systems, I am currently looking for an internship or job around my major. I hope to get accepted into a data analysis firm, or a banking firm. I am currently signed up with the handshake program by University of California Riverside. I am currently applying to jobs and internships. Hopefully, within the next six months, I get my application accepted.
